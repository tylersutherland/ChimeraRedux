To get the project to work you'll need to go into the properties of the desktop project and in the build path update the location of the android assets folder

Also, make sure to sync before you start working and to commit and sync whenever you change something so we don't have any weird errors.

So here's the major things we could be doing:

- Switching the level between seasons. Andre, I remember you saying you were thinking about looking into this, still true?

- Physics, Peter is working on this right now so if you want to do anything with this you should collaborate.

- Better Controls, We're still sort of up in the air with this but anything that's actually implemented will help us decide what control style we actually want.

- Interaction with the world. This is probably tide up in controls and the season switching stuff but it is still pretty important.

- Refactoring code, we don't have much code but it's always a good idea to simplify and consolidate where we can.

- Art, we can always use more art so if you can keep the current style and make some sprites, backgrounds, etc. that would be great.

Less Important right now but still vital:
- Expanding the menu system.
